INTRO

an analysis of astrological signs vs mbti. The goal is to see if any patterns can be found between astrological signs and MBTI letters - e.g. are Leos more extroverted than you'd expect?

Data set used is a dataset of celebrities and friends mbti and astrological sign and would be anonymised and made available by request.

The project is tabled for now while I find alternative sources of data. Given I only have ~150 datapoints and there are 12 signs, it was hard to draw any conclusions that were statistically significant. 

HOW TO 

run globals then run analysis. 
globals imports libraries and sets up my own zscore and binom functions (unneccessary but did it for practice).
analysis creates heatmaps and saves down a csv of signs with counts and z scores of each mbti letter and functional pair by sign.
