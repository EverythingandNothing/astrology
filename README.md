an analysis of astrological signs vs mbti 
Data set used is a dataset of celebrities and friends mbti and astrological sign and would be anonymised and made available by request. 

run globals then run analysis. 
globals imports libraries and sets up my own zscore and binom functions (unneccessary but did it for practice).
analysis creates heatmaps and saves down a csv of signs with counts and z scores of each mbti letter and functional pair by sign.
